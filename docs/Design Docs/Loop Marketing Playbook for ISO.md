Loop Marketing is HubSpot’s new four-stage, AI-first playbook for driving discovery, search visibility, and revenue by continuously learning from every interaction and feeding those learnings back into your strategy. It assumes AI assistants and SERPs are the new “home page,” so your content, data, and offers must be designed to be found, interpreted, and amplified by both humans and AI systems.hubspot+2​

## **Core idea and why it exists**

Loop Marketing replaces the old linear funnel (attract → convert → close) with a loop that is always running and always improving from data. It recognizes that most discovery now happens in places you do not own (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, TikTok search, YouTube, social feeds), so you have to meet buyers where they are and bring them back to high-intent moments on your site.hubspot+2​

The loop has four connected stages: Express, Tailor, Amplify, and Evolve. Each stage uses AI both as a production co-pilot (to create and repurpose content) and as an analysis engine (to spot what is working and feed it back into the loop).[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​wildfigmarketing+1​

## **The four Loop stages**

* Express – Define and show who you are: your positioning, POV, and core narrative expressed clearly across content, offers, and brand experience.[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​[hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-search-diversification)​

* Tailor – Use AI and your CRM data to personalize messages, sequences, and creative to specific segments and individuals.wildfigmarketing+1​

* Amplify – Diversify and distribute content across channels and “AI surfaces” (search, AI answers, social, video, ads) so humans and bots can find, quote, and link to you.hubspot+1​

* Evolve – Continuously learn from performance and behavior data, then rapidly adjust messaging, offers, formats, and channel mix to improve the next loop.wildfigmarketing+1​[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​

Teams using Loop treat every interaction (click, watch time, reply, conversion) as a data point to refine the next wave of content and targeting rather than a dead-end metric.hubspot+1​

## **AI-first search and traffic concepts**

AI-first discovery in Loop focuses on:

* GEO (Generative Engine Optimization): making your content easy for AI assistants and generative search to ingest and reference, similar to SEO but optimized for AI answers instead of just blue links.hubspot+1​

* AI-referred traffic: traffic that arrives after a prospect has already asked questions in an AI system, which HubSpot says converts multiple times better than traditional search because the buyer has been pre-qualified and educated.wildfigmarketing+1​

* Channel diversification: assuming you cannot rely on a single search channel, so you deliberately spread content across YouTube, social, web, email, communities, and paid while letting AI help repurpose assets into multiple formats.[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​[hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-search-diversification)​

The idea is that you design content and offers that answer real questions, structure them so AI tools can understand and surface them, and then capture that higher-intent traffic with a strong site and CRM-backed follow-up.hubspot+1​

## **Practical techniques at each stage**

**Express – Strategy and content foundation**

* Clarify POV: Document a sharp, opinionated stance on your category, ideal customer, and main problems solved; this becomes your “source of truth” for AI-assisted content.[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​[hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-search-diversification)​

* Hero assets: Create a few deep pillar pieces (guides, videos, webinars) that express this POV and can be atomized into shorts, posts, emails, and ads.[wildfigmarketing](https://www.wildfigmarketing.com/blog/introducing-loop-marketing-hubspots-solution-for-growth-in-the-ai-era)​[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​

* Structured content: Use clear headings, FAQs, and schema-like organization so both search engines and generative models can parse and reuse your content.hubspot+1​

**Tailor – Personalization with AI and CRM**

* Segment from CRM: Use your CRM data to define key segments based on behavior, industry, lifecycle stage, and product interest.[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​[wildfigmarketing](https://www.wildfigmarketing.com/blog/introducing-loop-marketing-hubspots-solution-for-growth-in-the-ai-era)​

* AI-assisted personalization: Use AI to generate variations of emails, landing pages, ad copy, and scripts for each segment while keeping guardrails from your brand POV and compliance.wildfigmarketing+1​

* Journey alignment: Map touchpoints (content, offers, CTAs) to the buyer’s stage so people seeing you first via AI search get appropriately advanced content when they finally reach your site.hubspot+1​

**Amplify – Distribution, GEO, and reach**

* Multi-channel distribution: Publish core content on your site, then repurpose into YouTube videos, shorts, carousels, LinkedIn posts, emails, and podcast clips, using AI to speed up repurposing.[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​[hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-search-diversification)​

* Optimize for AI and search: Make sure content is crawlable, concise in answering questions, and mapped to real queries so it is likely to be quoted or summarized by AI tools.wildfigmarketing+1​

* Paid \+ partners: Use targeted ads and partner channels to put your strongest loop content where ideal customers already pay attention, then measure which channels drive the highest-intent visits.[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​[wildfigmarketing](https://www.wildfigmarketing.com/blog/introducing-loop-marketing-hubspots-solution-for-growth-in-the-ai-era)​

**Evolve – Measurement and feedback**

* Real-time insight: Use AI and analytics to track engagement and conversion signals (e.g., which videos retain viewers, which pages close deals, which prompts drive replies).[wildfigmarketing](https://www.wildfigmarketing.com/blog/introducing-loop-marketing-hubspots-solution-for-growth-in-the-ai-era)​[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​

* Fast iteration: Regularly refine messaging, creative, offers, and channel mix based on those signals instead of waiting for big quarterly campaigns.hubspot+1​

* Compounding learnings: Use what works in one channel (e.g., a high-performing YouTube topic) to inform your SEO content, AI prompt strategy, and creative in other channels.[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​[hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-search-diversification)​

## **Step-by-step guide to employ Loop**

**Step 1 – Define your Loop strategy (Express)**

1. Choose your core audience and primary problem you solve, and write a simple positioning and POV doc.hubspot+1​

2. Outline 3–5 pillar topics that matter most to that audience and map where they search and learn today (Google, YouTube, TikTok, AI tools, communities).[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​[hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-search-diversification)​

3. Create one or two flagship assets per pillar (e.g., deep video \+ blog \+ lead magnet) that express your POV clearly and are built to be repurposed.[wildfigmarketing](https://www.wildfigmarketing.com/blog/introducing-loop-marketing-hubspots-solution-for-growth-in-the-ai-era)​[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​

**Step 2 – Set up data and personalization (Tailor)**  
 4\. Clean and structure your CRM so contacts, companies, and deals connect and can be segmented by role, industry, behavior, and lifecycle stage.hubspot+1​  
 5\. Define 3–6 key segments (for example, SMB vs mid-market, new vs expansion, key industries) and create AI-assisted messaging frameworks and offer ladders for each.wildfigmarketing+1​  
 6\. Configure journeys and workflows (emails, in-app, chatbots, nurtures) so when people arrive from AI search or content, they receive segment-specific follow-ups.[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​[wildfigmarketing](https://www.wildfigmarketing.com/blog/introducing-loop-marketing-hubspots-solution-for-growth-in-the-ai-era)​

**Step 3 – Build AI-first content and distribution (Amplify)**  
 7\. For each pillar, record a master video or long-form piece, then use AI to slice into shorts, clips, post drafts, email outlines, and ad variations.[hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-search-diversification)​[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​  
 8\. Publish to your site with strong on-page optimization (clear answers, structured headings, internal links) and then distribute versions across the channels your audience uses most.wildfigmarketing+1​  
 9\. Implement GEO best practices by ensuring your content directly answers common questions, uses clear language, and is technically easy for generative systems to parse and attribute.hubspot+1​

**Step 4 – Instrument and measure (Evolve)**  
 10\. Set up dashboards to track AI-referred and search-driven traffic, engagement (watch time, scroll depth, replies), and downstream revenue by channel and asset.wildfigmarketing+1​  
 11\. Use AI-assisted analysis to surface patterns (which topics, hooks, offers, or channels correlate with the best customers and fastest sales cycles).[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​[wildfigmarketing](https://www.wildfigmarketing.com/blog/introducing-loop-marketing-hubspots-solution-for-growth-in-the-ai-era)​  
 12\. Run short, frequent experiments: update hooks, thumbnails, CTAs, and sequences weekly or monthly based on those patterns and feed wins back into the Express and Tailor stages.[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​[wildfigmarketing](https://www.wildfigmarketing.com/blog/introducing-loop-marketing-hubspots-solution-for-growth-in-the-ai-era)​

**Step 5 – Operationalize the loop**  
 13\. Assign ownership: one person for POV and messaging, one for content production, one for distribution, one for analytics; make a shared “Loop board” where experiments and learnings live.[wildfigmarketing](https://www.wildfigmarketing.com/blog/introducing-loop-marketing-hubspots-solution-for-growth-in-the-ai-era)​[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​  
 14\. Establish a recurring Loop review (for example, every two weeks) to decide what to double down on, what to cut, and what new tests to run across channels and formats.hubspot+1​  
 15\. Continuously refine your prompts, templates, and workflows so AI becomes a central, reliable part of your creation, distribution, and measurement stack.[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTPLCazQAE)​[wildfigmarketing](https://www.wildfigmarketing.com/blog/introducing-loop-marketing-hubspots-solution-for-growth-in-the-ai-era)​

If you share your current main offer and channels (e.g., YouTube \+ Instagram \+ search), the Loop stages can be translated into a concrete channel-by-channel plan tailored to your stack.
