You can structure all your website copy around the 7 StoryBrand elements: Character, Problem, Guide, Plan, Call to Action, Avoid Failure, and Success. Below is a practical, implementation-ready breakdown for your dev and content team, with direction for homepage, services, and key pages.creativeo+3​

---

## **1\. Define the Character (Customer)**

Clarify who the site is for and what they want most in relation to your offer. This should appear in the hero section headline and subheadline, not in an “About us” paragraph.gravityglobal+2​

For implementation:

* Create 1–3 primary customer profiles (e.g., “busy small business owners who need more leads without more complexity”).bigorange+1​  
* Write a hero headline that clearly states what they want, framed as a benefit, not a feature (e.g., “Get More Qualified Leads from Your Website”).rutkinmarketing+1​  
* Use supporting copy under the headline to briefly restate who it’s for and the result (e.g., “We help local service businesses turn browsers into booked appointments.”).[gravityglobal](https://www.gravityglobal.com/blog/complete-guide-storybrand-framework)​

On the site:

* Homepage hero: “Customer \+ Desired Outcome” as H1; avoid clever slogans.bigorange+1​  
* Navigation labels: Use plain-language labels that reflect what the character is seeking (e.g., “Get More Leads,” “Book More Sessions”) rather than internal jargon.[connectivewebdesign](https://connectivewebdesign.com/blog/storybrand-framework)​

---

## **2\. Articulate the Problem**

StoryBrand emphasizes three layers of problem: external (surface issue), internal (frustration), and philosophical (why it shouldn’t be this way). Customers buy solutions to internal problems, so the site must state those clearly near the top.rutkinmarketing+1​

For implementation:

* List the top 3–5 external problems your customer faces (e.g., “low traffic,” “inconsistent inquiries,” “confusing tools”).creativeo+1​  
* For each external problem, write the internal frustration in simple language (e.g., “You’re tired of guessing what’s working.”).gravityglobal+1​  
* Add one brief philosophical line capturing the “should/shouldn’t” (e.g., “Growing your business shouldn’t require a full-time marketing degree.”).rutkinmarketing+1​

On the site:

* Add a “The Problem” or “What You’re Facing” section under the hero with bullets that combine external \+ internal problems.bigorange+1​  
* Mirror these problems on services pages so each service is explicitly tied to solving a specific problem.[o8](https://www.o8.agency/blog/building-storybrand-how-use-storytelling-framework-clarify-your-messaging)​

---

## **3\. Position Your Brand as the Guide**

Your brand is not the hero; it is the guide that understands the hero’s struggle and has authority to lead them. This is expressed with empathy (you get their struggle) and authority (proof you can help).gravityglobal+1​

For implementation:

* Write 2–3 short empathy statements that reflect the internal problem in the customer’s own voice (e.g., “We know how frustrating it is to pour time into marketing that doesn’t convert.”).rutkinmarketing+1​  
* Collect 3–7 authority signals: years in business, clients served, testimonials, case results, certifications, logos.creativeo+1​

On the site:

* Add a “You Need a Guide” or “Why Work With Us” band that starts with an empathy sentence, then immediately shows authority items (metrics, testimonials, or logos).bigorange+1​  
* Ensure the “About” page focuses more on how you help customers win than on your origin story.[o8](https://www.o8.agency/blog/building-storybrand-how-use-storytelling-framework-clarify-your-messaging)​

---

## **4\. Provide a Clear Plan**

The plan shows the simple path from “where they are” to “success,” typically in 3–6 steps. StoryBrand distinguishes between a process plan (how to work with you) and an agreement plan (how you remove risk/objections).innatemarketinggenius+2​

For implementation:

* Define a simple 3–4 step process plan (e.g., “1. Schedule a call, 2\. Approve your strategy, 3\. Launch your campaign, 4\. Grow your business”).roionline+1​  
* Identify top objections (cost, time, complexity, risk) and turn them into 3–5 short “agreements” (e.g., “No long-term contracts,” “Transparent reporting,” “Done-for-you setup”).innatemarketinggenius+1​

On the site:

* Add a “How It Works” section with numbered steps and a visual or icons, placed above the fold or just below hero/problem.connectivewebdesign+1​  
* Add a short “Our Promise” or “What You Can Expect” list that summarizes the agreement plan near CTAs and on pricing/offer pages.[innatemarketinggenius](https://www.innatemarketinggenius.com/storybrand-framework/)​

---

## **5\. Strong Calls to Action (Direct and Transitional)**

StoryBrand distinguishes between direct calls to action (buy now, book a call) and transitional calls to action (lead magnet, free resource) for visitors not ready to buy.gravityglobal+1​

For implementation:

* Choose 1 primary direct CTA phrase and use it consistently (e.g., “Schedule a Strategy Call,” “Get a Free Quote”).rutkinmarketing+1​  
* Choose 1–2 transitional CTAs (e.g., “Download the Marketing Checklist,” “Watch the Free Training”) that solve a slice of the main problem and capture email.creativeo+1​

On the site:

* Place the direct CTA button in the top-right nav and in the hero, repeated in at least 3–5 sections on each core page.connectivewebdesign+1​  
* Place the transitional CTA in a feature band (e.g., mid-page) and in a site-wide module (banner or footer) so non-ready visitors still have a next step.o8+1​

---

## **6\. Show the Stakes: Failure to Avoid**

People move when they feel the cost of inaction. StoryBrand includes “avoid failure” as an explicit element of the narrative. This should be present but not fear-mongering or manipulative.gravityglobal+1​

For implementation:

* List 3–5 negative outcomes of not solving the problem (e.g., “wasted ad spend,” “missed leads,” “stalled revenue,” “burnout”).rutkinmarketing+1​  
* Translate them into short, straightforward sentences or bullets, framed around what the customer wants to avoid.[rutkinmarketing](https://rutkinmarketing.com/blog/marketing/storybrand-framework-transform-your-marketing-strategy-and-roi/)​

On the site:

* Add a compact “If Nothing Changes” or “What’s at Risk” section near the bottom of the homepage using bullets to describe these negative outcomes.bigorange+1​  
* Mirror a lighter version of this copy on key service/offer pages, contrasted immediately with success outcomes.[connectivewebdesign](https://connectivewebdesign.com/blog/storybrand-framework)​

---

## **7\. Paint the Vision of Success**

End the story by making success concrete and visual so visitors can see themselves winning. Success should match the desires outlined in the Character and Problem sections.gravityglobal+1​

For implementation:

* Define 3–7 specific success outcomes (e.g., “predictable lead flow,” “simpler systems,” “more time for clients,” “higher revenue per client”).bigorange+1​  
* Turn these into bullets and 1–2 short summary paragraphs that describe a “future state” life or business.[gravityglobal](https://www.gravityglobal.com/blog/complete-guide-storybrand-framework)​

On the site:

* Add a “What Success Looks Like” or “Imagine This” section with bullets \+ a short paragraph near the bottom, just before the final CTA.connectivewebdesign+1​  
* Use testimonials and brief case snapshots to show real-life examples of this success.o8+1​

## **8\. Map StoryBrand to Page Structure**

Teams often know the 7 parts but struggle to translate them into sections and wireframes. A standard StoryBrand-style homepage can be structured as follows.connectivewebdesign+1​

## **Recommended homepage section order**

| Section (Top → Bottom) | Primary StoryBrand Element(s) |
| ----- | ----- |
| Hero (headline \+ CTA) | Character, Desire, Direct CTA |
| Problem/Pain section | External, Internal, Philosophical problem |
| Guide (Why us \+ proof) | Guide (empathy \+ authority) |
| Plan (How it works) | Plan (process \+ agreement highlights) |
| Benefits / Success band | Success outcomes |
| Lead magnet / Free resource | Transitional CTA |
| Social proof (testimonials) | Guide authority \+ Success |
| Stakes \+ final CTA band | Avoid Failure \+ Direct CTA |

Use the same mapping logic on services and offer pages, but more focused: restate the specific problem, clarify the outcome, show the plan, provide proof, and end with a strong CTA.o8+1​

## **9\. Implementation Checklist for Your Team**

For practical build-out, your dev/content team can use this as a working checklist across the site.creativeo+1​

* Confirm a single clear hero statement that names the customer and their desired outcome.rutkinmarketing+1​  
* Ensure a visible, consistent primary CTA appears in the nav, hero, and multiple scroll points.connectivewebdesign+1​  
* Add a dedicated problem section that names external and internal problems explicitly.bigorange+1​  
* Add a guide section with empathy statements plus 3–7 authority signals (logos, stats, testimonials).creativeo+1​  
* Include a 3–4 step “How it works” process plan with short labels and 1-line descriptions.roionline+1​  
* Define at least one transitional CTA (lead magnet, free resource) and place it site-wide.o8+1​  
* Add a “What’s at risk” band that briefly outlines the cost of inaction.gravityglobal+1​  
* Add a “What success looks like” band that clearly paints the positive future state, reinforced with proof.bigorange+1​

If you share your specific offer and audience, a tailored StoryBrand-style outline can be drafted that your team can plug directly into your CMS or design system.
